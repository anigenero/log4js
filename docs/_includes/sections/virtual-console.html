<h1>Virtual Console</h1>
<p>
    This library utilizes a virtual console to intercept console logs from other libraries/scripts. This is intended
    to allow usage of this library without having to replace all console.log commands within your code - or to intercept
    logs from third-party libraries to input into your own log stream. Make sure log4js2 is loaded at the top of the
    page to ensure that all logs are caught.
</p>

{% highlight typescript %}
import * from 'log4js2';

console.log('console log');

// outputs: 08-30-2018 12:38:00 [INFO] main - console log
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    To disable this feature, set the <code>virtualConsole</code> property to false when configuring log4js2.
</p>

{% highlight typescript %}
configure({
    // ...
    virtualConsole: false
});
{% endhighlight %}
